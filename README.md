## Description
In this Regex Tutorial, you will learn how to validate the featured email address regular expression (regex) **Regex Featured in This Tutorial:** `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. The tutorial provides a comprehensive breakdown and explanation of each component within the regex, simplifying the validation process for easy understanding. Upon completing this tutorial, you will gain a deeper comprehension of how the regex functions to validate and confirm the entry of a valid email address.

## The Challenge
In this challenge, you will utilize the knowledge gained from the tutorial and apply it to the creation of a comprehensive tutorial on email validation using regex. The following steps were taken to achieve this:

1. Conducted a thorough literature review on the structure and format of email addresses.
2. Identified the necessary components that need to be validated in an email address, utilizing information from peer-reviewed sources.
3. Created a regex pattern that validates email addresses based on the identified components.
4. Set up a GitHub Gist, following the instructions provided in the "Installation Process" section.
5. In the newly created Gist, composed a brief explanation of the regex pattern created for email validation, describing each component and its purpose in the validation process. This explanation was informed by academic sources and tailored for novice coders and other academics.
6. Shared the link to the Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex pattern.

**The Following Sources Were Consulted:**
1. W3Resource. (n.d.). JavaScript: HTML Form - email validation. https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php
2. [Introduction to regular expressions video](https://youtu.be/7DG3kCDx53c)
3. [Regex Tutorial: Matching a Username](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-science/regex-tutorial)
4. Harvard University. (2022). CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/7/

These sources provided valuable information on the construction and usage of regex patterns for email validation, as well as insights into the pedagogical aspects of teaching regex to new coders and other academics. This knowledge was incorporated into the creation of the comprehensive tutorial, which aimed to provide an accessible yet academically rigorous explanation of email validation using regex.

## User Story

```md
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## What Is a Regex?

A **regex**, which is short for **regular expression**, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. 

For example, the following regular expression can be used to verify that user input is a valid email address:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the `@` symbol, followed by a domain.

## Usage Instructions:
1. Access the deployed GitHub Gist link.
2. Read through the introductory paragraph and summary.
3. Navigate through the table of contents to explore the different sections of the tutorial.
4. Read and understand each component of the regex pattern.
5. Apply the knowledge gained from the tutorial in your own projects.

## Installation:
**Set up a GitHub Gist:**

1. Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you haven't already.
2. Visit: https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.
3. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Email Regex Challenge".
4. Add a new file to the Gist by clicking on "Add file" and give it a suitable name, like "email_regex_challenge.md".
5. In your newly created Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose in the email validation process.
6. Explain how the regex can be modified to accept new requirements, such as uppercase letters or additional special characters in the email address.

**Share your Gist:**

7. Once you have completed the explanation and modifications to the regex, save your Gist by clicking on "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" as per your preference.
8. Share the link to your Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex.

By completing this challenge, you will not only have a better understanding of the email validation regex but also gain experience in setting up and sharing a GitHub Gist.
